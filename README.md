# Python Hashing Tool
This python script is used to calculate the SHA-256 hash for either a single file or the hashes for all the files within the specified. The hashes are stored in a text file containing a timestamp, the name of the files hashed, and the SHA-256 hash itself for easy exportation. The option to directly compare the hashes of two files is also included.
